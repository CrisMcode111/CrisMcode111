# ✨ Cristina M. 
### AI Creator • Raw Pastry Artisan • Lifelong Explorer of Nature, Textures & Human Stories

Hi, I’m Cristina — a woman who believes that **technology and culinary art can heal, transform, and open new worlds.**  
My identity doesn’t fit into just one box — and that’s exactly where my creativity comes alive.

By day, I study **AI, data, LLMs and computational creativity**.  
By night, I teach women how to create **raw sweet and savory recipes** that reconnect them with joy, intuition, and simplicity.

Between these two universes, I discovered my mission:  
**to build an AI capable of understanding textures, ingredients, and flavor logic — a digital sous-chef for the raw world.**

# 🌿 About Me

I’m passionate about **permaculture, wild edible plants and nature’s intelligence**,  
and I’m endlessly fascinated by how **food, emotions, and creativity intertwine**.

I am a mother, a learner, a creator, a woman who rebuilds herself again and again.  
Raw pastry, for me, is not just nutrition —  
**it’s engineering + art + inner alchemy**.

And now, I’m translating all of this into AI systems  
that understand textures, ingredients, gels, fibers, emulsions,  
and the hidden logic that makes raw cuisine alive.

# 🍰 Main Project — AI_raw_French_Gourmet

<details>
  <summary><h3>Click to open project details</h3></summary>

This is my flagship project — a specialized AI system that can:

- generate **raw sweet & savory recipes**  
- understand **texture logic** (creamy, elastic, crunchy, gelled, fluffy…)  
- diagnose mistakes and propose corrections  
- analyze **ingredient behavior**: hydration, gels, fibers, lipids, acidity  
- blend culinary creativity with structured food science  
- integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation + QLoRA fine-tuning  

The project combines:

- 🟡 Dataset A → Technical ingredient logic  
- 🟡 Dataset B → Raw recipes  
- 🟡 Dataset C → Cleaned & standardized data  
- 🟡 Dataset D → Prompting & system instructions  

📘 Full architecture: `/docs/architecture.md`  
📂 Datasets: `/data/`  

This is the most personal and ambitious work I’ve ever done —  
a bridge between my raw pastry world and my AI journey.

# 🌞 Upcoming Project — Solar AI Greenhouse  

<details>
  <summary><h3>Click to open project details</h3></summary>

A long-term project close to my heart:  
a **solar-powered, AI-assisted greenhouse** for regenerative agriculture.

It will explore:

- autonomous irrigation guided by plant & soil signals  
- frugal AI running on micro-hardware  
- sensor fusion inspired by permaculture  
- prediction of plant hydration, stress, and seasonal shifts  
- low-energy food cultivation workflows  

Born from my love for nature and edible wild plants,  
and my belief that **technology can support the Earth instead of draining it.**

And yes — I will build it. 🌱✨
