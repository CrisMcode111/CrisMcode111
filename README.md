# ✨ Cristina Moussoungedi  
### AI Creator • Raw Pastry Artisan • Lifelong Explorer of Nature, Textures & Human Stories

Hi, I’m Cristina — a woman who believes that technology and culinary art can heal, transform,  
and open new worlds. I was never meant to fit into just one box.


By day, I study **AI, data, LLMs and computational creativity**.  
By night, I teach women **how to create raw sweet and savory recipes that invite joy, playfulness, 
and a return to intuition.**

Between these two universes, I discovered my mission:  
**to build an AI that understands textures, ingredients, and the invisible logic of flavor — 
a digital sous-chef for the raw world.**


## 🌱 A bit about me

- I’m passionate about **permaculture, wild edible plants and nature’s intelligence**  
- I’m a mother, a learner, a creator, and someone who rebuilds herself again and again  
- I’m fascinated by **how food, emotions and creativity intersect**  
- I believe that **raw pastry is not just nutrition — it’s engineering + art + inner alchemy**  
- And now I’m translating this into **AI systems that can think like a pastry chef**

## 🔥 My main project  
### **AI_raw_French_Gourmet — a culinary AI system for raw dessert creation**

I am developing an AI pipeline able to:

- generate raw, no-nuts dessert recipes  
- reason about textures (creamy, elastic, crunchy, gelled…)  
- diagnose mistakes and propose corrections  
- understand ingredient behavior: gels, fibers, lipids, hydration  
- adapt recipes for children, beginners, and health-conscious people  

This project is a bridge between:
- **technical food science**  
- **AI reasoning (RAG, QLoRA, embeddings)**  
- **my lived experience as a raw pastry teacher**  

It is the most personal and ambitious project I’ve ever built.

## 🧠 Technologies I use (and love)

- Python • Jupyter Notebook • Git • GitHub  
- HuggingFace Transformers • QLoRA fine-tuning  
- LangChain • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- FAISS vector search  
- Streamlit for UI  
- Data cleaning, structuring and feature engineering  
- Knowledge modeling (& culinary logic!)

## 💛 Why I’m doing all this

Because food changed me.  
Because learning changed me.  
Because I want to help persons like you — stressed, tired, lost between roles — find joy again through simple, healthy, playful sweet and savory raw creations.
And because I truly believe AI can support creativity, not replace it.

My goal is to build technology that is  
**warm, intuitive, creative and deeply human.**

## 🍰 Fun fact  

I can talk for hours about:  
texturing gels, agar tolerances, buckwheat emulsions, hydrating seeds, acidic balances, fruit pectins, or how to “save” a broken raw cream using nothing but your intuition and an understanding of water activity.  

And now… my AI can too. ✨

## 🌞 Upcoming Project — Solar AI Greenhouse  
A long-term project close to my heart: building a **solar-powered, AI-assisted greenhouse** designed for regenerative agriculture and minimal-energy food production.

This system will explore:

- autonomous irrigation driven by plant and soil signals  
- frugal AI models running on micro-hardware  
- natural sensors inspired by permaculture principles  
- prediction of plant stress, hydration, and seasonal patterns  
- integration with culinary datasets for seed-to-plate intelligence  

It is a project born from my love for nature, edible wild plants, and the belief that  
**technology can support the Earth instead of draining it.**

And yes — I won’t stop until I build it. 🌱✨
